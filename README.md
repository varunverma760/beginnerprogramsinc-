To understand this you have to clear some topics/concepts: -




1. Operators in C





2. while, do while loop and for loop



3. break and continue





The fibonacci series is : 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21
It is a sequence where the next term is the sum of previous two terms .The  first two terms of the fibonacci sequence are followed by 0 and 1

Algorithm :-





Step 1 :- Start





Step 2 :- Float radius and double area




Step 3 :- Print radius




Step  4 :- Area of a circle( area = 3.14 *radius *radius)




Step 5 :- Print the area of circle




step 6 :- Exit





# conversion integer into corresponding floating number :-


//program 3

**Algorithm **:-
 
 
 
step 1 :- Start




step 2 :- print integer number and float number 




step 3  :- float number = integer number




step 4  :- exit





# greatest number 
**Algorithm**


Step 1 :- Start



step 2:- Print a, b and c


step 3:- If a>b do
         
         
   
   if a>c
         
  print a is greater than b and c
  
  
  else
  b>a and b>c
  
  print b is greater than a and c
  
  
  else 
  print c is greater
  
  
  
  step 4:- Exit
         
         
**LINEAR SEARCH PROGRAM USING AN ARRAY**

STEP 1 :- set i to 1


STEP 2 :- if i>n then go to step 7


STEP 3 :- if A[i] = x then goto step 6


STEP 4 :- Set i to i+1 


STEP 5 :- Go to Step 2



STEP 6 :- Print element x found at index i and go to step 8


STEP 7 :- Print element not found


STEP 8 :- Exit
