# conversion integer into corresponding floating number :-


//program 3

**Algorithm **:-
 
 
 
step 1 :- Start




step 2 :- print integer number and float number 




step 3  :- float number = integer number




step 4  :- exit





# greatest number 
**Algorithm**


Step 1 :- Start



step 2:- Print a, b and c


step 3:- If a>b do
         
         
   
   if a>c
         
  print a is greater than b and c
  
  
  else
  b>a and b>c
  
  print b is greater than a and c
  
  
  else 
  print c is greater
  
  
  
  step 4:- Exit
